      <p><h3>What is ehub?</h3><br>

E-hub offers accessible, affordable, interactive online courses that seek to empower our students to advance not just their education but their careers in technology.	We develop courses together with leaders in the tech industry to provide the most relevant and cutting-edge tech education that bridges the gap between academia and the needs of the 21st century workforce.</p>
<p><h3>How is E-hUB different from other online course offerings?</h3><br>

We develop all our courses with input not just from leading education experts but also industry experts such that the content is cutting-edge and most relevant to skills needed to advance your tech career. As such, we don't just teach you the "how's" but also the "why's." You won't just learn how to code, you will learn how to become a software developer. Our courses are also available at any time—start when you wish, fit it in your schedule, learn on-demand. And most importantly, you will learn by doing and building projects that you can showcase to others.</p>
    <p> <h3>How can my company, university, or school use E-hub</h3><br>

We've worked with many company executives, university professors and high school teachers that want to use E-HUB for their employees or students. We offer special enterprise tools and pricing. </p>

        <h3>Courses</h3>
        <p><h3>What is a E-HUb course like?</h3><br>

E-HUB courses are highly interactive with activities, quizzes, and exercises interspersed between short videos and interviews with instructors and industry experts. You can watch the videos and try the quizzes as many times as you like without any penalties. The quizzes are a tool to help you learn.

Usually after a lesson, there will be a problem set with exercises for you to check if you have learned the material in that lesson. Just like with the quizzes, you can try them as many times as you like without penalty.

Ehub courses also include a project that you can add to your portfolio. Whether it is a blog, search engine, game, or app; EHub will help you build something that demonstrates your skills to friends and employers.

And perhaps the best part of being enrolled in a ehub course is access to your own personal Coach that will be there to support your success every step of the way.</p>
<p><h3>When does each course begin?</h3><br>

All of our courses are open enrollment—you can start a course at any time, on-demand, and at times that fit in your schedule.

New courses often open for enrollment before the course material is available. These are noted in the course catalog as "coming soon" and will show a time when we expect the course to start on the Course Overview page. If you pre-enroll in one of these these courses, you will receive an email both when you enroll and when the course becomes available.</p>
<p><h3>Can I enroll in any ehub course?</h3><br>

Only select ehub courses are currently available for full course enrollment, but we are actively upgrading existing free courseware and creating new courses that will be available soon. Keep checking our course catalog for the latest updates and exciting new additions.</p>
<p><h3>Are there deadlines within each course?</h3><br>

There are no deadlines for E-HUB courses. You may complete them at your own pace. However, we do provide guidance as to how long you can expect the course to take if you dedicate ~5 hours per week to the course. With a full course enrollment, your personal ehub Coach can also help you personalize a schedule and set deadlines to achieve your learning goals.</p>
<p><h3>How much time will a E-hub course take?</h3><br>

Our courses vary in length and we provide an estimate of how long each course will take on the Course Overview page. This estimate is based on the time it takes a typical student who regularly dedicates 5 hours per week to complete the course. The actual time will vary considerably from individual to individual—so don't be surprised if it takes you more or less time. Ultimately, you can take as much or as little time as you need to complete the course in a time that fits your schedule.</p>

        <h3>Coaches</h3>
        <p><h3>Who are the ehub Coaches?</h3><br>

<p><h3>How can Coaches help me learn more effectively?</h3><br>

Our Coaches work one-on-one with you through the entire course experience. They can confirm whether the class is right for you, suggest and monitor pacing to fit your unique lifestyle and goals, share helpful study tips, provide detailed instruction on all concepts or programming exercises in the course, and give personalized feedback on any project you are building in the course. This personalized attention can accelerate and deepen your learning to reach your career goals.</p>
